 ## YAITS WEB SERVICE ASSIGNMENT CHECKLIST:
 - Below is the assignment sent to me and the list of requirements/features that I implemented.

 Unity desperately needs yet another issue tracking service (YAITS!) and has chosen you to design and build the backend for it. Other developers should be able to use HTTP requests to invoke APIs that...

- [X] get a list of issues
- [X] search issues via attribute criteria matching (e.g. find issues of priority 7 or higher)
- [X] create a new issue
- [X] update an issue
- [X] delete an issue

Issues should...
- [X] be unique (primary key column)
- [X] have a short description (title column)
- [X] have a detailed description
- [X] have a priority
- [X] have a status (e.g. open, closed) (status column)
- [X] be assignable to a team member
- [X] ...and include anything else you deem necessary.

Too easy? Feel free to also consider...
- [ ] simple frontend forms/pages to expose the APIs for end users
- [X] tests
- [X] deployment scripts/tools
- [ ] authentication
- [ ] a system for inviting members into a team
- [ ] conditional access to a subset of issues by non-team members
- [ ] allowing members to comment on issues
- [ ] voting for issues
- [ ] ...or anything else that strikes your fancy.

When you're ready, you should...
- [X] include a short description of your design, discussing any trade-offs/compromises, scale, or performance issues, along with what the future might hold for extending your service,
- [X] create a new git repository (or a similar shareable version control) at the start of your project, make sensible check-ins throughout your project, and
- [X] zip up your repo (including the version control directory) and send it to us at least 24 hours before you arrive onsite.

Remember, this is your chance to show us your skills! Various generators are fine to start out with but are unlikely to highlight why you'd be a great hire.
We'll walk through your app during the interview. Be prepared to pair up with an interviewer to work on it (if possible, bring a laptop with your app ready to prod and poke).
Please keep this work private and do not host it in a public source repository or any other open facility.

 We expect this to take anywhere from one to four hours. Feel free to reach out to Brad Robel-Forrest at 425-390-4139 (SMS preferred) if you have questions while working through the problem (expect a response within about one hour between 08:00 and 22:00 Pacific).
